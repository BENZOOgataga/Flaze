Hi dear FlazeBot community!

**Today we are launching our brand new Changelog feature!** It will allow you to receive FlazeBot updates in a specified channel instead of getting bored and going to our Discord server or even our GitHub/Documentation.

**Changelog** can be configured by typing `+changelog` with one of the following permissions: Owner of the Discord Guild, `adminrank` or `Administrator` permission.

:warning: __**Important**__ :warning:
At the moment, this feature is a bit limited by Discord API and we are preserving our performances to let people use the bot while Flaze is sending all changelog to all guilds.
Note that Flaze is not being used by a lot of guilds and like so we are currently experiencing this system. It will probably receive modifications.

For further informations or if you have questions, please do consider visiting us at https://discord.flazebot.com/
