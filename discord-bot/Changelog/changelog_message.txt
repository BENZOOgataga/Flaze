<:flaze:905582762231201823> Hey FlazeBot community!

Today, we are launching the brand **new version** of FlazeBot, the **1.1 version**. Which means we are now passing on **stable builds**. 
Here is a **recap** of all the **new features** and **modifications** made to **FlazeBot**: 
• Radio Status command: Allows you to **check** the **listeners** and **listeners peak** of **each radio**.
• Playlist: **get** all the **playlists** and **songs** of FlazeBot. 
• We added a **new playlist**: **US Rap**. 
• New feature: FlazeBot **reconnects** itself to the **voice channel** if it **disconnects from** an **error** (so you don't waste time reconnecting it manually, kinda quality of life change) 
• FlazeBot now **stops playing music** when **nobody is in** its **voice channel**, but **restart** playing **music** when **someone joins** its **voice channel** (with the configuration and play instructions given by the DJ) 
• Many **bug fixes and security improvements** that will be shut for obvious reasons. 

Thanks to the FlazeBot translators, we now have **Portuguese language**. **German and Italian** are coming soon... We will **keep you updated** by the **changelog system** (see documentation in Changelog section if you don’t know what I’m talking about)

**Sound quality** has been **updated** from `64 kbps` and `44.100 Hz` to `96 kbps` and `48.000 Hz` :musical_note:

**Good news** for **developers**, **an API has been** proudly **made** by chredeur (the Flaze owner) to **allow** you **getting** little **informations** about FlazeBot! (Maybe FanBots :shushing_face:)

**Concerning the documentation**, we **added radio status** and all aliases, **playlist** and aliases and **images** were added to **play and leave commands** to make the **understanding easier** :wink:

As an happy ending, **we have answered Discord's questions** about our bot behaviour and maybe **FlazeBot is going an a fresh verifed way**. Happy 1.1 version :tada:
