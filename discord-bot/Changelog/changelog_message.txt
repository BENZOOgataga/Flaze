Hi dear FlazeBot community!

We're sorry to leave you as this, but Discord has done something that will block us from coding and making our bot even better. If you would like to know more about this we suggest you to read completely the link below, but for now we're leaving with a big stop mark on FlazeBot Project.
As you probably know FlazeBot is coded in discord.py and this library just ended being supported, so now we're here announcing that we're taking our "baggages" and going on a brand new trip to Minecraft Plugins.

Hope we'll stay in touch, ciao :cry:
