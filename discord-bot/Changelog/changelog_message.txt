CHANGELOG :newspaper:

Hey! Want fresh news? Flaze is updating to version 2.3! Let's gooo :tada:

<:flaze:1020658416496160788> FLAZE WEBSITE
       ﹂ We now have a **dashboard** which allows you to check the current music, change radio, see next song and more!
             ﹂ https://dashboard.flazebot.com/
             ﹂ Some features are currently not available, they are coming in a different dashboard version.
       ﹂ As we updated `/flazeinfo` command (which you can read more about below), FlazeBot, Website and Dashboard are considered as different services.
       ﹂ Dropdowns have been reworked a bit so they may not bug as much as it was before.

:radio: Radio
       ﹂ We added Bass radio! Turn up the volume :smile:
       ﹂ We also added ES Rap, a playlist made by Khyllux :wink:
       ﹂ We added music to Rap US and FR.
 
:map: Translation
       ﹂ :flag_de: :flag_cn: :flag_ru: We are still highly searching for German, Chinese and Russian translators!

:desktop: Dev
       ﹂ We added many services to help maintaining FlazeBot, not really much you can see.
       ﹂ New `/search` command. It may allow you to search for songs in radios!
       ﹂ `/settings` command has been reworked a lot, it may be even more efficient!
       ﹂ `/flazeinfo` has received some changes: 
             ﹂ server category is not shown anymore, 
             ﹂ versions of Flaze services are now shown.
       ﹂ A new system introduces itself, the Timer Radio, which is part of the `/settings` command.
       ﹂ Many little improvements on FlazeBot efficiency, it may play and execute commands faster and better.
       ﹂ Our infrastructure has been **entirely** reworked, we have our own servers and that's why this update took a bit of time to come out.
             ﹂ We now have someone new in Flaze Team, luc13680as which is our System Administrator!
       ﹂ All advertisements concerning our previous Partner have been removed.
       ﹂ Many bug fixes and corrections.

Have a great and enjoyable day!
